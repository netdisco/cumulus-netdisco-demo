Introduction
------------

This repository is a demo for using Netdisco in a
https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-vx/[Cumulus] VX
https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant[Network].

The steps below will spin up a network of: two spine routers, four leaf
routers (in MLAG pairs), four servers dual-connected to upstream leaf
switches, an OOB management switch, and an OOB server.

On the OOB server will be running an instance of Netdisco Backend in a Docker
container. This is configured to connect to PostgreSQL running on your host
computer system.

Preparation
-----------

Before running this demo, install
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] and
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant].

You will need to edit the Vagrantfile, to change the `NETDISCO_DB_NAME` and
`NETDISCO_DB_USER` for your system. _Do not change ``NETDISCO_DB_HOST``_.

[[startup]]
Startup
-------

....
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/netdisco/cumulus-netdisco-demo.git
cd cumulus-netdisco-demo && vi Vagrantfile
vagrant up && vagrant up --provision ssh-mgmt-server
....

Access Netdisco Backend
-----------------------

Should you wish to visit the backend docker container:

....
vagrant ssh
docker exec -it netdisco-backend sh
....

The Netdisco configuration is in `./environments` as usual.

[[caveats]]
Caveats
-------

You will need to run the web frontend on your workstation. Obviously,
this does not share configuration with the backend docker container
running on `oob-mgm-server`. You will also need a provisioned (deployed)
and up-to-date Netdisco database schema.

So far, SNMP::Info is not doing a good job with the Cumulus platform.
This will not be hard to fix.
