Introduction
------------

This repository is a demo for using Netdisco in a
https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-vx/[Cumulus] VX
https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant[Network].

The steps below will spin up a https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant[reference network] of: two spine routers, four leaf
routers (in MLAG pairs), four servers dual-connected to upstream leaf
switches, together with an out-of-band (OOB) management switch and server (not shown):

On the OOB server will be running an instance of Netdisco Backend in a Docker
container. This is configured to connect to PostgreSQL running on your host
computer system.

Preparation
-----------

Before running this demo, install
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] and
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant].

You will need to edit the Vagrantfile, to change the `NETDISCO_DB_NAME` and
`NETDISCO_DB_USER` for your system. _Do not change ``NETDISCO_DB_HOST``_. You
may also add `NETDISCO_DB_PASS` if required.

[[startup]]
Startup
-------

....
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/netdisco/cumulus-netdisco-demo.git

cd cumulus-netdisco-demo && vi Vagrantfile
# edit the DB configuration as mentioned above

vagrant up && vagrant up --provision oob-mgmt-server
....

[[access-netdisco-backend]]
Access Netdisco Backend
-----------------------

Should you wish to visit the backend docker container:

....
vagrant ssh
docker exec -it netdisco-backend sh
....

The Netdisco configuration is in `./environments` as usual.

[[caveats]]
Caveats
-------

You will need to run the web frontend on your workstation. Obviously,
this does not share configuration with the backend docker container
running on `oob-mgmt-server`. You will also need a provisioned (deployed)
and up-to-date Netdisco database schema.
